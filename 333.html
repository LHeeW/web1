    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language
        that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level,
        often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
        It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation,
        and first-class functions.
        Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the
        World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of
        web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior
        and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
        As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional,
        and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for
        working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
        and the Document Object Model (DOM).
